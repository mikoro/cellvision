## Features

- Multiplatform (Windows, Linux and Mac OS X)
- Image data can be loaded from multipage TIFF image files
- Image metadata can be loaded from external files
- Volume image is visualized with a plane that intersects the volume
- Multiple different images (channels) can be visualized at the same time
- Multiple ways to move and control the camera
- Measurement tool that can measure real world distances inside the image
- Useful visual aids that help understand orientation in the world

## Instructions

Browse for the image file from the UI. Then either input manually the image specifications or browse for a metadata
file and automatically load all the values from it. Enable some or all of the color channels and select which image channel's
data will be visualized with which color. Then clicking *Load windowed/fullscreen* will update the visualization view.
